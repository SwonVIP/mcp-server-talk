- **Footer Position:** Bottom of slide with adequate spacing
- **Background:** Linear gradient (purple to red)
- **Notes:**
  - Welcome everyone
  - Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  - MCP servers enable LLMs to interact with the digital world
  - Will explain how they work and why they matter

## Slide 2: The Toolbox Analogy
### Part 1
- **Title:** The Toolbox Analogy
- **Visual:** Toolbox visual (placeholder)
- **Notes:**
  - Craftspeople need different tools for different tasks
  - Screwdrivers for connecting things
  - Measuring tools for information gathering
  - Power tools for complex operations
  - LLMs need tools to interact with the digital world effectively

### Part 2
- **Title:** The Toolbox Analogy
- **Content:** "LLMs need specialized tools"
- **Visual:** Digital toolbox for LLMs (placeholder)
- **Notes:**
  - MCP servers are specialized tools
  - Each MCP server solves specific problems
  - File access, API connections, database queries
  - Without tools, LLMs limited to text generation with no real-world action

## Slide 3: The M×N Problem
- **Title:** The M×N Problem
- **Visual:** Before/after standardization comparison
- **Notes:**
  - Computer industry faced similar problem before standardization
  - Early days: Proprietary connectors for each component
  - Different standards per manufacturer
  - M×N problem: Connecting N devices to M computers required M×N different connectors
  - Solved through standardization: USB, SATA, PCIe
  - AI industry at similar inflection point with tool integration

## Slide 4: MCP as the "USB-C for AI Applications"
- **Title:** The "USB-C for AI"
- **Content:**
  - M×N Problem (highlighted in red)
  - M+N Solution (highlighted in green)
- **Visual:** M×N vs M+N diagram
- **Background:** Blue gradient
- **Notes:**
  - Before MCP: Each AI integration required custom code
  - M applications × N systems = M×N integrations
  - After MCP: Standardized protocol transforms problem
  - M applications + N systems = M+N implementations
  - Just as USB-C standardized physical connections, MCP standardizes AI connections
  - Dramatic efficiency gain reducing development effort

## Slide 5: Core MCP Architecture
### Part 1
- **Title:** Core Architecture
- **Visual:** Architecture diagram
- **Notes:**
  - MCP uses client-server architecture
  - Transport-agnostic and extensible
  - Standardized communication protocol
  - Enables diverse components to work together
  - Allows for local and remote operation

### Part 2
- **Title:** Core Architecture
- **Visual:** Components diagram
- **Content:** List of components
  - Hosts
  - Clients
  - Servers
- **Notes:**
  - Key components:
  - MCP Hosts: User-facing applications (Claude Desktop, IDEs like Cursor)
  - MCP Clients: Components maintaining 1:1 connections with servers
  - MCP Servers: Programs providing capabilities to AI models
  - Transport Layer: stdio for local, HTTP/SSE for remote connections
  - Each component has specific role in a flexible system

## Slide 6: MCP Server Capabilities
### Overview
- **Title:** Server Capabilities
- **Visual:** Capability overview
- **Notes:**
  - MCP servers expose three main types of features
  - Each serves different purpose in the MCP ecosystem

### Tools
- **Title:** Server Capabilities
- **Subtitle:** 1. Tools (highlighted in blue)
- **Visual:** Tools visualization
- **Notes:**
  - Functions the LLM can call to perform specific actions
  - Model-controlled: LLM decides when to invoke them
  - Like power tools the LLM operates
  - Execute code, make API calls, query databases
  - Example: search_docs tool lets LLM find information in knowledge base

### Resources
- **Title:** Server Capabilities
- **Subtitle:** 2. Resources (highlighted in green)
- **Visual:** Resources visualization
- **Notes:**
  - Provide context and data the AI model can use
  - Like reference materials in a toolbox
  - Files, logs, database content
  - Access typically initiated by Host application
  - Conceptually similar to GET requests without computation/side effects
  - Example: IDE integration providing file context to model

### Prompts
- **Title:** Server Capabilities
- **Subtitle:** 3. Prompts (highlighted in red)
- **Visual:** Prompts visualization
- **Notes:**
  - Templated messages and workflows
  - Like instruction manuals for complex tools
  - User-controlled, not decided by the LLM
  - Ensure requests are properly structured and consistent
  - MCP server developer provides templates as domain expert

## Slide 7: Communication Flow
- **Title:** Communication Flow
- **Visual:** JSON-RPC flow diagram
- **Notes:**
  - Communication uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages
  - Typical flow:
  - LLM selects appropriate Tool/Resource based on user request
  - Request sent as JSON-RPC message
  - Server validates request parameters
  - Server processes and executes request
  - Server formats and returns response
  - LLM integrates response into final output
  - Standardized protocol ensures consistent communication

## Slide 8: Implementation Details
- **Title:** Implementation
- **Visual:** SDK logos and deployment options
- **Notes:**
  - Available SDKs:
    - Python, TypeScript

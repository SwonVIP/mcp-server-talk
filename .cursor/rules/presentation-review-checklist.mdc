### Original Splitting Issues (Resolved)
1. ✅ Slide 5 (Core Architecture): Split into:
   - 5a: Overview of client-server architecture
   - 5b: Detailed components with two-column layout

2. ✅ Slide 7 (Communication Flow): Split into:
   - 7a: Overview of the flow and protocol
   - 7b: Detailed steps with two-column layout

3. ✅ Slide 11 (Best Practices): Split into:
   - 11a: Security measures
   - 11b: Implementation practices with added content

## Visual Appeal

### Background and Color
- [x] Appropriate use of background colors/gradients
  - Title slide has purple gradient
  - USB-C slide has blue gradient
  - Security slides have red background
  - Best practices slides have dark blue background
  - Use cases slide has blue gradient
  - Conclusion matches title slide for cohesion
- [x] Consistent color scheme throughout
- [x] Good contrast between text and backgrounds
- [x] Strategic use of highlight colors for emphasis (blue, green, red)

### Typography
- [x] Consistent font sizes across similar elements
- [x] Sufficient text size for readability
- [x] Limited font variety (using theme defaults)

### Animations and Transitions
- [x] Effective use of fragments for sequential reveals
- [x] Appropriate slide transitions (zoom for section changes)
- [x] Auto-animate features used effectively between related slides
- [x] Consistent animation style throughout
  - fade-up for sequential points
  - fade-in for supporting details
  - fade-right/left for two-column layouts

### Layout
- [x] Good use of space on each slide
- [x] Logical arrangement of content
- [x] Consistent positioning of recurring elements
- [x] Effective use of columns and grids where appropriate
  - Two-column layouts on complex slides
  - r-stack for Use Cases slide

### Images
- [x] Placeholders clearly marked for replacement
- [x] Visual balance between text and images
- [x] Images properly sized and positioned

## Final Recommendations

1. ✅ Split content-heavy slides as identified above - COMPLETED
2. Replace image placeholders with actual visuals before presenting
3. Review speaker notes before presenting
4. Consider adding additional auto-animate transitions between other conceptually related slides
5. Test presentation flow with a timer to ensure appropriate pacing (aim for 1-2 minutes per slide)

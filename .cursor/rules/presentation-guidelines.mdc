# Presentation Structure Guidelines

## General Structure
- Keep slides simple and focused on one main point per slide
- Use consistent styling throughout your presentation
- Consider your audience's perspective and needs
- Aim for 1-2 minutes per slide on average

## Content Guidelines
- Use short, concise bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Include relevant images, diagrams, or charts to illustrate points
- Keep code examples short and highlight important parts
- Use transitions and animations purposefully, not gratuitously

## Technical Tips
- Test your presentation in the environment where you'll present
- Ensure all media (images, videos) is properly loaded
- Have a backup plan in case of technical difficulties
- Practice navigating through your slides, including vertical navigation
